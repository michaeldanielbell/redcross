Landing page for Nomadic communities affected by Drought

Inside the repository you can find the static design files and html markup.

### Intro
I felt like 3 hours was a bit of a rush for a task like this and I designed what I wanted first and then had to rush through the implemation taking into consideration responsiveness and interactivity and general tidyness.

### Further improvements
I would have liked to make it more dynamic with a d3.js map / styled google map. Along with using more modern tooling like scss and es6 / rollup / babel
Responsive styling was also last minute.

### Distribution strategy:
I would have this as a standalone page under the main IFRC website. But I would also publish the article on Medium as the content is quite engaging, I could see it being used in a more longform structure.
